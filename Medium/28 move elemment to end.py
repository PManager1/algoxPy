# You are given an array of integers and an integer. Write a function that moves all
# instances of that integer in the array to the end of the array. Return the array.

# The function should mutate the input array, (using same array,  )
# i.e. the operation should be performed in place,
# and doesnâ€™t need to maintain the order of the integers.

#input = [2,1,2,2,2,3,4,2]; // 2
#out = [1,3,4,2,2,2,2,2];  we dont care abt the order of the other numbers, only the 2s shoudl be at the last.
