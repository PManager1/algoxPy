# Given a non-empty string, we are asked to write a function that is going to run-length-encode the input string
# and return the encoded string.
# Run-length encoding refers to replacing repetitive, consecutive data by a count and one copy of a repeated data.
# For instance, AAABB will be encoded as 3A2B

# If a sequence contains more than 9 consecutive, identical characters, we first encode 9 characters,
# then the remaining ones.
# For instance, AAAAAAAAAA (10 As) will be encode as 9A1A.
