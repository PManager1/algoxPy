# You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer
# amount representing a total amount of money.

# Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money
# cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
# You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

# Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
# Example 2:
#
# Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
# Output: -1
# Example 3:
#
# Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
# Output: 0


# target = $6.   # points givn = [1,2,4]
# Find the minmum no of couins out of these given coins that we need to reach $6.
# assume that we hace infinie amount of coins  i.e i can use any number of $1 coins/ or $2 coins.
